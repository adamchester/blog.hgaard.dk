I am a Danish full stack software engineer and architect with
15y+ experience. I do web, security cross-platform mobile development
and everything in-between. I am known to be a person who challenges
the well-known with a positive mind, both when it comes to building
solutions, improving the development process and choosing platform,
language or technology. I am inspired by functional programming languages,
which is reflected in my approach to programming and I strive
to become a polyglot developer. Privately I am a father of two boys and a
girl and married to a sociologist doing UX Research. We live in Brisbane,
but are often found hanging out on the local beaches trying to surf and
play with our kids.
