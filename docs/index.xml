      <description>I recently started a new job. Actually I moved from Copenhagen to Brisbane, Australia with my whole family, just to try living and working in a different country - and of course to give our 3 kids and ourselves a great experience/ adventure. Anyway, I got a job in the Australian consultancy Readify and one of the perks there is PD or Professional Development for up to 20 days a year.</description>

      <description>I recently joined a project that had been working on a product for a few years already. The team had used TFS for source control until just a few weeks before I joined. Because of external circumstances the team had decided to migrate the complete source tree to git (still hosted on TFS though).
After the migration to the new git repository it turned out that the repository was quite big, to more precise it was around 1,2 GB.</description>

      <description>The last year or so at Schultz we have started to use git for more and more projects, and I have become the goto guy for git related issues. The last few times new developers have joined my project or started a new project using I have compiled an email with useful links on git and git from Visual Studio. So thought I might just put it in a blog post instead.</description>

      <description>This is an introduction post! Oh well I guess one can&amp;rsquo;t stat a blog without some kind of introduction. I&amp;rsquo;m software developer, a husband, a dad and a lot of other stuff. I really enjoy working in technology and I truly get thrilled when diving into new shiny languages, frameworks and tools.
I&amp;rsquo;m starting this blog because I want to archive some my thoughts and programming experiments. Who know it might be useful later.</description>

      <title>Managing external users with Azure AD B2C</title>

      <description>The last few weeks I have been working with a customer to implement Azure AD B2C login for their internal systems and I thought I might share my experience with you.
###What is Azure AD B2C First of all I might need to explain a few things, like what B2C is (assuming here that you know what Azure and AD are) and what kind of problem I am solving with it.</description>
